# Shopping Website

This is a sample e-commerce shopping website Build using the Web Components. It provides a pattern for a real-life shopping cart and store checkout flow.

Technologies : LitElement , LitHTML , JSON

I built this application based on the project below.
https://github.com/Polymer/shop
Above project was built using polymer web components. In my project I used to build Lit Element which was a new version of polymer webcomponents. 


To serve the site locally, run:


```bash
npm run serve
```

There is a development HTML file located at `/dev/index.html` that you can view at http://localhost:8000/dev/index.html.


The site will usually be served at http://localhost:8000/dev/
